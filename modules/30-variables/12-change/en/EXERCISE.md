In the exercise, a variable is defined with a string inside it. Override the value of this variable and assign it a string in which the characters of the original string are arranged in reverse order.

Note: in this assignment, you'll have to write code between lines with comments `# BEGIN` and `# END` (we mentioned it before, but this is the first time you've come across this format).

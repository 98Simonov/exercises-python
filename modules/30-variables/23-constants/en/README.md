Some data never change - for example, mathematical constants. Take Ï€ as an example. It is always 3.14 and cannot change. Python uses constants to refer to this kind of data:

```python
PI = 3.14
print(PI)  # => 3.14
```

A constant is created in the same way as a variable. The only difference is that constants are usually named with capital letters have and `_` as a separator between words. A constant, like a variable, can be used in any expression.

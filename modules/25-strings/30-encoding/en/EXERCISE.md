In Python, you can query and display any ASCII character. The function `chr()` is used for this. For example:

```python
print(chr(63))
```

Symbol no. 63 - the question mark `?`. You can print any character this way.

Use the [ASCII code table](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html).  In this table, want to know about the decimal code (*dec* or *decimal*) with which the characters are encoded.

Using the example above and the table, display the following (each on its own line): `~`, `^` and `%`.

(Of course, you could be sneaky and cheat the tests by just doing `print('~')` etc., but that would be no fun at all :)

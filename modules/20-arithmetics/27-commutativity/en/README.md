"An operation will not change if the operands are moved” is one of the basic laws of arithmetic, also called **the commutative law**. A binary operation is considered commutative if you get the same result even if you swap the operands. In this case, addition is a commutative operation: `3 + 2 = 2 + 3'.

But subtraction is not a commutative operation: `2 - 3 ≠ 3 - 2'. In programming, this law applies just like it does in arithmetic. Moreover, most of the operations we encounter in real life are not commutative. Here's the takeaway: always pay attention to the order of things you work with.

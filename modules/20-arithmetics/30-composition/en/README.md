Let's look at an example:

```python
print(2 * 4 * 5 * 10)
```

The operations can be combined with each other to calculate increasingly complex compound expressions. To give you an idea of how calculations are done inside the interpreter, let's look at an example: `2 * 4 * 5 * 10`.

1. First, we calculate `2 * 4` and get the expression `8 * 5 * 10`
2. Then `8 * 5`. The result is `40 * 10`
3. Then, we get the last multiplication, which gives us `400`

Operations may contain different operators, which raises the question of their priority.

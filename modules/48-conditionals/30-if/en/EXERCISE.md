Implement a function called `guess_number()` that takes a number and checks if the number is equal to a given number (let's say 42). If it's equal, the function should return the string `'You win!'`, otherwise it should return the string `'Try again!'`.

```python
guess_number(42) # You win!
guess_number(61) # Try again!
```

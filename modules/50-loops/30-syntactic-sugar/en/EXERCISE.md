Implement a function called `filter_string()` that takes a string and a character as input, and returns a new string with the character removed from every point in the string. Try not to use the built-in methods for working with the string in your solution.

```python
text = 'If I look back I am lost'
filter_string(text, 'I')  # 'f  look back  am lost'
filter_string(text, 'o')  # 'If I lk back I am lst'
```

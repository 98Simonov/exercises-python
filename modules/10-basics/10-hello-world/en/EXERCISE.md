Copy the exact code from the instructions into the editor and run it by clicking “Run”.

```python
print('Hello, World!')
```

Note: if you write `heLLo, woRld!` instead of `Hello, World!`, it will be considered different text, because upper and lower case letters are different characters and different _registers_. In programming, the register almost always matters, so get used to always paying attention to it!

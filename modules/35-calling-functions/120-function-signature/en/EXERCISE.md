Now it's your turn, look at the signature of a function in the documentation and work out how to use it.

Python has a function called `hex()`. Study its signature [here](https://docs-python.ru/tutorial/vstroennye-funktsii-interpretatora-python/funktsija-hex/).

Write a program that uses the `hex()` function with the variable `number` and displays the result on the screen.

User input data often contains extra spaces at the end or beginning of a string. They're usually cut out using a method [.strip()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html), for example, it was ``hello\n'`` and now it's ``hello'``.

Update the `first_name` variable by writing the same value to it, but this time processed by the `.strip()` method. Print the result.

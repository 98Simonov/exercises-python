Methods are expressions, like variables or function calls, which means they can be combined in different ways.

For example, you can use them in operations:

```python
name = 'Shaya'
'hi, ' + name.upper() + '!'  # hi, SHAYA!
```

Or in function parameters:

```python
name = 'robb'
print(name.lower())  # => robb
num1 = 5
num2 = 30
# bit_length() - calculates the number of bits needed to represent a number in binary form
print(num1.bit_length() + num2.bit_length())  # => 8
```

You are given three variables with the names of different people. Make and display a word of characters in this order:

1. The third character from the first line
2. The second character from the second line
3. The fourth character from the third line
4. The fifth character of the second line
5. The third character from the second line

Try using interpolation: not only whole variables can be placed inside curly brackets, but also individual characters using square brackets.
